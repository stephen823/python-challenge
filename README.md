# python-challenge
This project is composed of two segments

Part 1 
This segment of the project involves an analysis of a bank's financial records. Python is used to find total profit over the period, average profit, average change in profit, highest profit increase and the highest decrease in losses. 

Part 2
In this segment, I will develop an algorithm to help a small town to count election votes and decide the winner in a more efficient manner.
